					<h2>About </h2>

					<p>
					Hello! This page is for introducing myself, and for me to put more things about myself!<br/>
					</p>

					<p>
					To start off with introductions, my name is Yu Ke Ying. 
					I go by Yukagi because it is a lot easier to pronounce and remember. 
					It's a play on my name, where I rearrange 'Ke Ying' as 'Key ing'.
					From there, I used the word 'Key' and translated it into Japanese, which is how I got 'Kagi'
					Therefore, putting my surname together with it gives me 'Yukagi"
					I know it lacks creativity and its not funny at all, I just like it and have been using it for a rather long time, so i've gotten used to using it online, and even being called by that name when I'm conversing with people online.
					</p>

					<p>
					I'm currently an 18y/o (turning 19 this year) student studying in Singapore Polytechnic. 
					I'm taking the Diploma in Digital Animation(DDA) and am currently in my second year.
					My primary school was Maha Bodhi School, and my secondary school was Cedar Girls' Secondary School.
					After graduating from secondary school, I went to Anderson Serangoon Junior College, but I dropped out after a year.
					</p>

					<p>
					My hobbies include drawing, singing, sleeping, playing games, and I like doing a lot of hands-on activities.
					</p>
